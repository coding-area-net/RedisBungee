The maintainer of RedisBungee has became inactive, so we have taken the development of the plugin.

RedisBungee uses [Redis](https://redis.io) to Synchronize data between all proxies like: 
* [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord) proxies
* [Velocity](https://github.com/PaperMC/Velocity) proxies
* *note: they can work with each other without issues*

## Api usage and project compilation 
RedisBungee is distributed as a [maven](https://maven.apache.org) project.

*todo: adding how to compile it + using it in your plugin*

## Javadocs

## Configuration

**REDISBUNGEE REQUIRES A REDIS SERVER**, preferably with reasonably low latency. The default [config](https://github.com/limework/RedisBungee/blob/v1.0.0/src/main/resources/example_config.yml) is saved when the plugin first starts.
